      <h2>About Me...</h2>
      <p>
        I've been using computers for as long as I can remember. In fact, we do
        have a desktop that is older than me! It is one of those boxed model
        computers and has Windows 98 installed on it. I had a pretty fun time
        using it as a kid, but as I grew older it couldn't keep up with my needs
        anymore, so like any other old item, it is now packed and stored as a
        legacy object.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always had a passion for the modern world. After watching Ironman
        movies, I decided I wanted to be someone like him. Having robots and
        talking to AIs fascinated me. So, like any other kid, I started asking
        around what should I learn and pursue to become someone like Mr. Stark!
      </p>
      <p>
        That's until the first year of high school. By then, I have already
        decided I wanted to be a mechanical engineer. Little did I know
        mechanical engineering has nothing to do with AIs! I become aware of an
        extracurricular class called Robocups when I entered high school. Like
        those anime characters with starry eyes, I was excited to join this
        class but had a problem! There was an entrance exam and it was not
        specific only to my school, which meant students from other schools
        would be taking this exam as well. We had a match and I needed to study.
        I wanted a sit in that class and was not ready to back down!
      </p>
      <p>
        After a month of study, it was time for the entrance exam. It was on an
        autumn weekend when I entered a building with hundreds of students all
        wanting to take that same exam. Was I nervous? Sure, who wouldn't be?
        But my hard work has paid off and I was granted a sit when they
        announced the results. But I would be lying if I said I wasn't
        disappointed! You see, before the class started I always thought we were
        going to learn how to build robots but at the first session, we were
        informed that this was actually a programming class. In fact, we were
        learning how to write codes to simulate a 2D Soccer game.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I look back, I realize I wouldn't continue this path if it wasn't
        for my magnificent mentors, Mr. Zavareh Mohammadi and Mr. Mohajer. They
        showed us the beauty of the computer world and I appreciate it. The way
        they taught us made me love programming. I mean, I did continue my
        studies as a computer software engineer at university, didn't I?
      </p>
      <p>
        To this day, I still write codes, learn new things, and new languages,
        and am definitely still fascinated by AIs.
